- Use these items with **phpstudy.exe**.
- Find the directory location of 'phpstudy.exe', make sure there is no file in `...\phpstudy_pro\WWW.` (maybe your path is `C:\tools\phpstudy\phpstudy_pro\WWW`), then put all these items in it.
- Open phpstudy and configure the relevant information. (my php version is 5.5.9).
-  Make sure that both the username and password are `root` in `127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin`.
- Open your Chrome Browser and type in`127.0.0.1` or `127.0.0.1/index.php`.



That's all! HAVE FUN!



I will try to update these items.
